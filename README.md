ABSTRACT
Fuzzy logic control was developed to control the compressor motor speed , fan speed , fin direction and operation mode to maintain the room temperature at or closed to the set point temperature and save energy and keep devices from damage. This paper describes the development of Fuzzy logic algorithm for Air Condition control system. This system consists of four sensors for feedback control: first for input electric volt which used to save devices from damage due to alternated voltages, second for temperature and third for humidity and fourth for dew point.
