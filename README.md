Algorithm
-Define linguistic Variables and terms (start)
-Construct membership functions for them. (start)
-Construct knowledge base of rules (start)
-Convert crisp data into fuzzy data sets using membership functions. (fuzzification)
-Evaluate rules in the rule base. (Inference Engine)
-Combine results from each rule. (Inference Engine)
-Convert output data into non-fuzzy values. (defuzzification)
-Development
